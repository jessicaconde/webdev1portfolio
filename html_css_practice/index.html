  <div class="tight-width"><div class="box"><p class="white-text">i have 5 dogs, all of which are almost impossible to get into one picture, so here they are separately. from left to right: clark, bruce, diana, pepper, and snuggy. clark, bruce and diana are pepper's kids, all named after the justice league! they actually have a neat lil instagram page that my dad made for them, which you can find <a href="http://instagram.com/pugstice_league" target="_blank">here</a>.</div></div>

    <br><div id="clark-box"><p class="white-text"><b>clark</b> is the youngest but ironically the biggest out of his siblings, and also the only pug out of the 4 that has light colored fur. unlike his siblings, he always listens to the commands given to him, and is overall a very playful boy. he isn't afraid to pee everywhere though!</div> 
    
    <div id="bruce-box"><p class="white-text"><b>bruce</b> is the 2nd oldest.  he is the pure dog embodiment of "head empty, no thoughts". he's the only one that sits when we give him a bath, and the only one that sits and stares at you no matter how much you call his name. dude literally doesn't care about a single thing.</div> 
    
    <div id="diana-box"><p class="white-text"><b>diana</b> is the oldest and the smallest out of her siblings, and also the only girl. she's easily the calmest out of the bunch, but tends to be the most stubborn (she won't listen to any commands unless you have food to reward her with). she loves to cuddle and crawl on the people she loves. </div> 
    
    <div id="pepper-box"><p class="white-text"><b>pepper</b> is the momma of clark, bruce and diana. just like clark, she's very playful--it's kinda difficult to pet her since she's always in the mood to play. helping her give birth was an experience. she's probably the most horrifying pug i've ever seen, but that just adds to her charm.</div> 
    
    <div id="snuggy-box"><p class="white-text"><b>snuggy</b> is the only chihuahua of the bunch, and also the first dog we've ever had. she's got the worst attitude too--she pretty much barks at anything that moves. she's the most cuddly though, and probably the only dog i've ever seen sleep under a blanket.</div>
