    <p><font size="5">★★★★☆</font>
    <br><br><font face="calibri" size="3">my opinion on the internet is mostly positive. i mean, i met some of my closest friends on there that i otherwise would've never met since they're on different sides of the earth. the internet is also one of my main sources of entertainment. without youtube, discord, instagram, snapchat, tik tok, etc. i'd be pretty bored during my free time. along with that, information is very very easily accessible thanks to the internet, but i guess that's a double edged sword. the internet breeds false information just as quickly as it does true information. not to mention all the privacy concerns, since sites often collect and store your data (specifically sites that require an account to access it). overall, i think the way the internet affects someone just boils down to how that person handles it, at least to an extent.

    <br><br>solid 4/5 from me. i dont think i'd be able to live without the internet, honestly.
